# Flappy Bird - The Game Remake

_Rules are simple: tap to elevate the bird to not hit anything in the world._

Flappy bird is a legendary game, created by Dong Nguyen, came out in 2013 for mobiles.
The game did not provide many features and possibilities (basically it is just a tapping game), yet it became one of the most popular mobile game in history.
There was a huge peak in players number in 2014, and the game made 50,000$ from ads per day. Even though many people loved the game, some of them hated it.
Nguyen got a lot of messages, many requests for interviews, also insults and death threats. He had enough of it, and made him delete the game from app stores.

I am amazed how successful this simple game could get, so I wanted to create my own version of it using Pixi js with Typescript.

### Try it out [here](https://kucupwn.github.io/Pixi-Flappy-Bird/)!

## Game modes

Originally there was only one game mode, but I made two. The main difference is in the initial speed.
The games speed is increased two times as passing through obstacles (by default after 20th and 50th obstacles), at the same time obstacles distance is adjusted to game speed.

### Normal mode

This is the closer one to the original. Starts kinda slowly, speeds up to moderate.

### Rapid mode

This is a bit more extreme version, it has a wider canvas to see obstacles better. Buckle up, this is fast.

### Loved creating this game, taught me a lot about JS objects, Pixi js and Typescript. Looking forward to face the next coding challenge.

_The textures and sounds are not created by me, I only used them for this fun project._
